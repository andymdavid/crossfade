# Productize Template

Phase 1 foundation for the Productize landing page. Built with semantic HTML, CSS variables sourced from `Design-Docs/01-Design-System.md`, and section structure from `Design-Docs/03-Section-Specifications.md`.

## Structure
- `index.html` – Complete section skeletons and semantic layout.
- `css/` – Reset, design tokens, typography, components, and layout styles.
- `js/` – Basic initialization stubs for navigation and animation scaffolding.
- `images/` – Placeholder folders for hero, process, benefits, and portfolio assets.

## Getting Started
Open `index.html` in a modern browser. All assets load locally; no build step required. Scripts are ES modules.

## Next Steps
Follow the Implementation Roadmap to enhance components (Phase 2) and add animations/responsive refinements (Phase 3+).
